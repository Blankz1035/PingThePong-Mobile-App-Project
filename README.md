# PingThePong-Mobile-App-Project #

## Introduction

Simple, Fun 2 player game designed with the Ping Pong aspect, created in Unity *The aim of the game is for 2 players to have an enjoyable game of ping pong and bring back the age of arcade.


## Game Engine

I used *Unity* to create the game as it is well known for being a powerful engine for creating physics based games. I learnt a lot and enjoyed the experience.  I also used visual studio for editing the "c#" scripts as I am familiar with this program.
